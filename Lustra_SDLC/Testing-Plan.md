## **2. Testing Strategy**
Lustra will follow an Agile testing approach, with testing integrated into each sprint. Continuous feedback and iterative improvements will ensure robust quality assurance.

### **2.1 Testing Phases**

| **Phase**             | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Unit Testing**      | Tests individual components and functions |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensures seamless interaction between different modules |
| **System Testing**    | Validates the entire platform's functionality |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Confirms the system meets user requirements |
| **Security Testing**  | Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection |
| **Performance Testing** | Evaluates the systemâ€™s speed, scalability, and stability |

## **3. Testing Types and Objectives**

### **3.1 Unit Testing**
- Verify individual functions and modules in frontend and backend.
- Automate using **Jest** (Frontend) and **Mocha/Chai** (Backend).
- Ensure correct input and output responses.

### **3.2 Integration Testing**
- Test API endpoints and database interactions.
- Use **Postman** and **JUnit** for validation.
- Ensure smooth data flow between frontend, backend, and database.

### **3.3 System Testing**
- Test complete workflows (e.g., course navigation, blog access).
- Simulate real-world user interactions.
- Validate functional and non-functional requirements.

### **3.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
- Conduct end-user testing sessions.
- Gather feedback and refine the platform.
- Ensure user experience is intuitive and bug-free.

### **3.5 Security Testing**
- Perform **penetration testing** to identify vulnerabilities.
- Validate **authentication and authorization mechanisms**.
- Ensure compliance with **OWASP security guidelines**.

### **3.6 Performance Testing**
- Conduct **load testing** using **JMeter**.
- Test **scalability** under increased traffic.
- Optimize database queries and API responses.
