**Deployment Plan for Lustra E-Learning Platform**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
The deployment plan outlines the steps, tools, and resources required to successfully deploy the Lustra e-learning platform. It ensures a smooth transition from development to production, minimizing downtime and ensuring system stability.

### **1.2 Scope**
This plan covers deployment strategies, hosting environments, security measures, and post-deployment monitoring. The platform will be hosted on **Hostinger** with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and updates.
