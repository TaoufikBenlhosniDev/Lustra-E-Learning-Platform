                <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
                <p>A <strong>computer</strong> is an electronic device that manipulates and processes data according to a set of instructions (called programs or software). The main functions of a computer are typically categorized into <strong>input</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, <strong>storage</strong>, and <strong>output</strong>.</p>


                <p>Computers consist of two main components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardware</strong>: Physical parts of the computer, such as the CPU, RAM, motherboard, and peripheral devices like printers and monitors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software</strong>: The programs or instructions that run on the computer, such as operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and application software (Microsoft Office, web browsers).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>History of Computers</h2>
                <p>The history of computers spans several decades, with key developments and milestones marking each phase of advancement. Historically, computers can be classified into five generations, each reflecting the technological innovations of the time.</p>

                <h3>The Five Generations of Computers:</h3>

                <h4>1. First Generation (1940s - 1950s)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Vacuum tubes were used to perform calculations and store data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size</strong>: Computers were huge and occupied entire rooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) – the first general-purpose computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations</strong>: Vacuum tubes consumed a lot of power and generated a lot of heat, making them inefficient and unreliable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Second Generation (1950s - 1960s)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size</strong>: Computers were still large but began to shrink in size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: IBM 7090 – a transistor-based computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advancements</strong>: Reduced power consumption, higher processing speed, and more storage capacity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Third Generation (1960s - 1970s)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Integrated circuits (ICs), which placed multiple transistors on a single chip, enabled even smaller and more powerful computers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size</strong>: Personal computers started becoming more feasible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor), one of the first minicomputers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advancements</strong>: More efficient and reliable, faster processing, lower cost, and better user interfaces.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Fourth Generation (1970s - Present)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Microprocessors, where all components of a computer (CPU, memory, etc.) were integrated into a single chip, brought forth the personal computer revolution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size</strong>: Desktop and portable computers became popular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: Apple II (released in 1977) and IBM PC (1981), marking the beginning of the personal computer era.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advancements</strong>: Computers became accessible to individuals and small businesses, with the introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), laser printers, and more.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and advanced machine learning techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size</strong>: The focus is on increasing computational power and efficiency, with miniaturization continuing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: Quantum computers, though still in early stages, are expected to revolutionize processing power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advancements</strong>: AI systems capable of tasks like language translation, self-driving cars, and real-time data analysis. Future advancements might involve <strong>neuromorphic computing</strong>, which mimics the human brain's structure, and quantum computing, which could perform complex calculations in seconds.</li>
                </ul>
