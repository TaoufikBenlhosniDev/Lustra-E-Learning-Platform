            <div class="content">
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>At Lustra, we believe that learning technology should be clear, structured, and accessible to everyone. Whether you're taking your first steps in programming or advancing your expertise in software development, Lustra is designed to break down complex topics into simplified, easy-to-follow lessons.</p>
                <p>With an overwhelming number of resources available online, many learners struggle with finding the right path, staying consistent, and navigating complex concepts.
